This repository will create synthetic incoherenent scatter radar by creating filters from
ISR spectrums and applying them to CWGN. It is split up into three classes.
IonoContainer - A class that holds information on the ionosphere.
RadarData - A class that holds and operates on the radar data.
FitterMethods - A class that holds the fitter for the data.
